Hello guys, I am a new user of this plugin. I am trying to use it to generate a pdf with a table of contents. The table of contents is generated correctly, but the page numbers are not. I have tried to use the exact same code from the example in the documentation, but it still doesn't work. I am using version 0.12.3. This is my code:

    ---
    title: "Test"
